Cursor has released version 2.5, introducing a plugin marketplace for extensibility, enhanced security controls for sandboxed environments, and performance improvements to its agent capabilities.

## Plugin Marketplace Launches

The newly launched [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) allows developers to discover and install plugins that package skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single installation.

Initial partners include Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, and Stripe. These plugins cover workflows spanning design, databases, payments, analytics, and deployment.

Plugins can be browsed at [cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) or installed directly in the editor using the `/add-plugin` command.

More details are available in the [official announcement](https://cursor.com/blog/marketplace).

## Granular Sandbox Network Controls

The [sandbox](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal#sandbox-configuration) environment now supports granular network access controls alongside existing directory and file access controls. Developers can define precisely which domains the agent can reach while executing sandboxed commands.

Three control levels are available:

- **User config only**: Restricted to domains defined in `sandbox.json`
- **User config with defaults**: Restricted to user allowlist plus Cursor's built-in defaults
- **Allow all**: Unrestricted network access within the sandbox

Enterprise plan administrators can enforce network allowlists and denylists from the [admin dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard), ensuring organization-wide egress policies apply to all agent sandbox sessions.

## Asynchronous Subagent Execution

Previously, all [subagents](https://cursor.com/docs/context/subagents) ran synchronously, blocking the parent agent until completion. Version 2.5 enables asynchronous subagent execution, allowing the parent agent to continue working while subagents run in the background.

Subagents can now spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated work. This enables Cursor to tackle larger tasks such as multi-file features, extensive refactors, and complex bugs.

Performance improvements to subagents have also been implemented since the previous release, including lower latency, better streaming feedback, and more responsive parallel execution.

## Technical Context

The AI coding assistant market is experiencing a shift from single-agent systems to multi-agent architectures. The combination of parallel processing and specialized subagents represents a promising approach for efficiently handling complex coding tasks.

Network controls for sandboxed environments address a critical balance between AI agent autonomy and security. In enterprise settings, controlling AI agent external communications has become an integral part of zero-trust security strategies.

## Availability

Cursor 2.5 is available now. Full details can be found in the official [changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5).
