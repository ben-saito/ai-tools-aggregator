Anthropic has released Claude Code v2.1.59 with a handful of quality-of-life improvements that should make day-to-day usage noticeably smoother, headlined by an auto-memory feature and a new `/copy` command.

## Claude Now Remembers Things on Its Own

The headline addition is auto-memory: Claude will now automatically save useful context during sessions without you having to explicitly tell it to. Project conventions, your preferences, recurring patterns — it all gets captured and persisted across sessions. The existing `/memory` command remains available for manual management.

This is a natural evolution of the memory system that debuted earlier in the 2.x line. The difference is friction — or rather, the lack of it. You no longer need to remember to tell Claude to remember.

## /copy: Finally, Proper Code Block Selection

A new `/copy` command surfaces an interactive picker when your response contains code blocks. You can select individual blocks or grab the entire response. It's a small thing, but anyone who's fought with terminal text selection to extract a clean code snippet will appreciate it.

## Smarter "Always Allow" for Compound Commands

The permission system gets a subtle but meaningful upgrade. When you run compound bash commands like `cd /tmp && git fetch && git push`, Claude Code now computes per-subcommand prefixes instead of treating the entire string as a single prefix. The result: more granular, more secure permission management.

## Multi-Agent Sessions Get Leaner

For power users running multi-agent workflows, v2.1.59 releases completed subagent task state from memory. Long-running sessions with many subagent invocations should consume noticeably less memory.

## Bug Fixes

- **MCP OAuth race condition**: Fixed a token refresh race condition that surfaced when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously — a scenario that's increasingly common with multi-agent setups.
- **Deleted working directory**: Shell commands now display a clear error message when the working directory has been deleted, instead of failing silently.

## Minor Improvements

- Short task lists now display in a more logical order.

## How to Update

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```
