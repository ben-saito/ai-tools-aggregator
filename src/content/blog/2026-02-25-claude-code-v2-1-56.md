Anthropic has released Claude Code v2.1.56, addressing yet another trigger for the VS Code extension crash that has plagued Windows users over the past 24 hours.

## What's Fixed

The sole change in this release targets the "command 'claude-vscode.editor.openLast' not found" error — the same class of crash that v2.1.54 patched yesterday. A different code path was producing the identical error, and this release plugs that gap.

## Four Releases in One Day

If you're counting, that's four Claude Code releases on February 25th alone: v2.1.53, v2.1.54, v2.1.55, and now v2.1.56. All four are stability patches following the feature-heavy v2.1.52 release from the previous day, which introduced remote control support, plugin marketplace improvements, and a raft of memory leak fixes.

The rapid-fire cadence suggests Anthropic is prioritizing stability over new features this week — a reasonable call given the scope of changes in v2.1.52.

## How to Update

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

The VS Code extension updates automatically from the marketplace.
