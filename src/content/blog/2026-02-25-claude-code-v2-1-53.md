Anthropic has shipped Claude Code v2.1.53, a maintenance release focused on stability improvements and bug fixes. There are no new features this time around — instead, the team has been squashing bugs across platforms, with Windows getting the most attention.

## That Annoying Input Flicker? Gone

If you've noticed your input briefly vanishing after hitting Enter, you weren't imagining things. A UI flicker caused user input to momentarily disappear after submission before the message rendered. It's now fixed.

## Bulk Agent Kill Gets Smarter

Pressing `Ctrl+F` to kill all running agents used to fire off one notification per agent — not great when you're winding down a dozen teammates at once. Version 2.1.53 consolidates those into a single aggregate notification and properly clears the command queue.

## Remote Control Cleanup

Graceful shutdown while using Remote Control could sometimes leave stale sessions behind. The fix parallelizes teardown network calls, ensuring sessions are properly cleaned up even when the connection is flaky.

## `--worktree` Flag Fix

The `--worktree` flag was occasionally ignored on first launch. That's been corrected.

## Four Windows Crash Fixes

Windows users get the biggest win this release with four separate crash fixes:

- **"Switch on corrupted value" panic** — a general stability fix
- **Process spawning crash** — triggered when spawning many processes simultaneously
- **WebAssembly interpreter crash** — affecting both Linux x64 and Windows x64
- **ARM64 timeout crash** — a crash occurring roughly 2 minutes after launch on Windows ARM64 devices (think Surface Pro and similar hardware)

The ARM64 fix is particularly notable given the growing adoption of ARM-based Windows machines.

## The Bottom Line

No flashy features here, but v2.1.53 is the kind of release that makes everything else work better. If you're on Windows — especially ARM64 — updating is strongly recommended.
