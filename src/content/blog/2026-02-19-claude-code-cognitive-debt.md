UC Santa Cruz historian and Substacker Benjamin Breen published "What's Happening to Writing? Cognitive Debt, Claude Code, and AI's Peripheral Space"—an article that names Claude Code and Sonnet 4.6 directly while examining the long-term cognitive impact of AI coding tools on human cognition.

## Andrej Karpathy's Warning

The article centers on a statement from former OpenAI researcher and Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy:

> "I notice my ability to write code manually is slowly beginning to atrophy."

Karpathy praised the "phase transition in capability" of the past several months while honestly acknowledging the risk of skill loss from AI dependence. Coming from arguably one of the world's most code-literate individuals, this self-observation carries particular weight.

## The Author's Own Claude Code Dependency

Breen describes himself as part of "a small, obsessive Claude Code iceberg," having used it to build:

- **A history simulator** (historysimulator.vercel.app) — an LLM-driven historical narrative engine with pixel art graphics based on actual primary sources
- A Henry James prose style simulator using Gemini 3

This is a concrete example of AI coding tools enabling creative software development by people outside the traditional developer demographic.

## What Gets Lost, What Remains

**Potentially lost:**
- Manual coding ability (the Karpathy effect)
- The market for low-to-medium quality writing and development work (AI substitution)
- The premise that "this skill is rare and therefore valuable"

**What remains:**
- Work requiring physical presence or locality (electricians, archival historical research, classroom teaching)
- "Hybrid creation" with AI—the fusion of software and domain expertise
- Social and regulatory change lags technological change, so more occupations may be "AI-proof" than assumed

## The Practical Dimension

For developers actively using AI coding agents, this frames a concrete tradeoff:

- **Short-term productivity vs. long-term skill maintenance**
- As you "delegate everything" to agents, does your own debugging and design ability atrophy?
- If Karpathy's observation generalizes, the Claude Code generation of developers may lose the ability to write code by hand

This debate surfaces simultaneously with Claude Sonnet 4.6's release and its "Opus-level intelligence at Sonnet pricing" positioning. As capability increases, so does dependence—a structural question the industry has not yet resolved.
