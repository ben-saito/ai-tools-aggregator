Anthropic has pushed two rapid-fire hotfixes for Claude Code today — v2.1.54 and v2.1.55 — both targeting Windows-specific issues that slipped through the v2.1.53 release earlier the same day.

## v2.1.54: VS Code Extension Crash on Windows

The first patch addresses a crash in the VS Code extension on Windows. Users were hitting a "command 'claude-vscode.editor.openLast' not found" error on startup, preventing the extension from initializing. If you're a Windows VS Code user who suddenly found Claude Code's extension broken after updating, this is your fix.

## v2.1.55: BashTool EINVAL Error

The second patch, arriving roughly 30 minutes later, fixes BashTool — Claude Code's core command execution component — failing with an `EINVAL` error on Windows. Since BashTool is how Claude Code runs terminal commands on your behalf, this was effectively a showstopper for Windows users relying on the tool for anything beyond code editing.

## Three Releases in One Day

To put this in context: v2.1.53, v2.1.54, and v2.1.55 all shipped within the same day. The v2.1.53 release already contained four separate Windows crash fixes, and these two follow-up patches suggest the team discovered additional edge cases after that release went out.

The rapid turnaround speaks to Anthropic's current focus on Windows stability — an area that has historically received less attention in Claude Code's primarily macOS and Linux user base.

## How to Update

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

VS Code users can update through the Extensions panel as usual.
