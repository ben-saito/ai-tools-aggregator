Following the NBER study showing that roughly 90% of executives across 6,000+ businesses report AI has had no impact on productivity or employment over the past three years, software developer Danny McCuaig published a direct rebuttal on his blog.

## The Core Distinction: Organizational vs. Personal Productivity

McCuaig's argument is direct:

> "The CEO survey measures organizational productivity, which is an entirely different thing from what I experience. Most companies deployed AI and just expected to get better. No training, no workflow integration, no clarity on which problems the tools were meant to solve. This isn't AI failing. It's deployment failing."

## His Actual AI Stack

McCuaig's daily workflow:

- **Claude**: Coding assistance
- **OpenClaw**: Conversational thinking and brainstorming (previously done on paper or in notes)
- **Granola + custom plugin**: Automatic meeting transcription → Obsidian integration
- **Email triage**: Priority sorting before reading

**Concrete outcomes:**
- Recovers "20 minutes per day" from meeting note recording
- Code generation turns "someday I'll build that" into "finished this afternoon"
- Summarization, research, and email triage reduced from hours to minutes
- 30-40 minutes saved daily compounds into higher-quality focused work

## Why It Doesn't Show Up in Measurements

> "The 20 minutes saved on meeting notes doesn't appear in the quarterly report. The side project completed in a day doesn't register in productivity metrics. CEOs are looking for incremental improvements, but the actual benefits are granular and personal—invisible in a spreadsheet."

This, McCuaig argues, is the core of the "AI deployment failure." Deploying AI like an enterprise software purchase doesn't propagate the individual skill of knowing how to use it, which can only be cultivated through personal experimentation.

## An Honest Contradiction

McCuaig also acknowledges an unresolved tension: "I'm flowing more context to AI daily than Google's passive data collection ever captured. It's a contradiction I haven't resolved." But the productivity benefits are "too large to stop."

## What the Contrast Reveals

Set against the NBER executive survey, McCuaig's account doesn't argue AI doesn't work—it argues that **outcomes vary dramatically based on who uses it and how**. As AI coding agents evolve from code-writing tools to work-method-transforming tools, implementation success may depend less on tool selection and more on workflow design.

> "The gap isn't between AI's capabilities and its potential. It's between access to AI and knowing how to use it well. That's a personal skill built through experimentation, and it doesn't scale like enterprise software purchasing."
