Moonshot AI announced that Kimi.com now natively supports OpenClaw, enabling AI agents to run directly within browser tabs with 24/7 uptime. The integration, branded as "Kimi Claw," provides developers and users with access to over 5,000 community skills, 40GB cloud storage, and pro-grade search capabilities.

## Key Features

**ClawHub Access**
Users gain immediate access to the ClawHub library containing over 5,000 community-contributed skills. These skills can be discovered, invoked, and chained directly within Kimi.com without leaving the browser environment.

**40GB Cloud Storage**
Kimi Claw includes substantial cloud storage capacity for all files, addressing a common limitation in browser-based AI tools. This storage enables persistent workflows and data retention across sessions.

**Pro-Grade Search**
The integration includes advanced search capabilities that pull live, high-quality data directly from sources like Yahoo Finance. This feature enables real-time financial data access and analysis within the AI workflow.

**Bring Your Own Claw**
Developers can connect third-party OpenClaw instances to Kimi.com, enabling custom setups and bridging to external applications such as Telegram groups. This extensibility allows teams to integrate existing AI agent configurations into the Kimi ecosystem.

## Architecture

OpenClaw runs natively within Kimi.com browser tabs, providing:
- **Browser-Native Execution**: No external installations or dependencies required
- **24/7 Availability**: Persistent uptime for continuous agent operation
- **Direct Integration**: Seamless access to Kimi's existing capabilities alongside OpenClaw features

## Availability

The Kimi Claw integration is currently in beta, available to Allegretto members and above. Moonshot AI has not announced a timeline for broader public availability.

## Industry Context

This integration represents a significant expansion of browser-based AI agent platforms. By combining Kimi's conversational AI with OpenClaw's extensibility and the ClawHub skill ecosystem, Moonshot AI is positioning itself as a comprehensive platform for both end-users and developers building custom AI workflows.

The 40GB storage allocation is particularly notable, as it addresses one of the primary limitations of ephemeral browser sessions. This enables more complex, stateful workflows that were previously difficult to implement in pure browser environments.
