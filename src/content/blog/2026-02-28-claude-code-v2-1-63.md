Anthropic has released Claude Code v2.1.63, and this one's worth paying attention to. Alongside a handful of new features — HTTP hooks, bundled slash commands, and cross-worktree config sharing — the release tackles a staggering number of memory leaks that had been quietly eating RAM during long coding sessions.

## HTTP Hooks: Webhooks for Claude Code

The headline feature is HTTP hooks. Until now, Claude Code's hook system was limited to running shell commands. With v2.1.63, hooks can POST JSON to a URL and receive JSON back, opening the door to direct integration with external web services and APIs without the overhead of spawning shell processes.

## New Slash Commands: /simplify and /batch

Two new bundled slash commands join the lineup. `/simplify` does what you'd expect — asks Claude to reduce complexity in selected code. `/batch` enables grouping multiple operations into a single command, useful for repetitive refactoring tasks.

## Git Worktree Config Sharing

For developers who work across multiple git worktrees of the same repository, project configs and auto-memory are now shared automatically. No more duplicating `.claude/` settings across worktrees.

## The Memory Leak Reckoning

The real story of this release is the sheer volume of memory leak fixes. Anthropic's team clearly went on a hunt, and they found problems everywhere:

- **Bridge polling loop** listener leak
- **MCP OAuth flow** cleanup leak
- **Hooks configuration menu** navigation leak
- **Interactive permission handler** listener leak during auto-approvals
- **Bash command prefix cache** unbounded growth
- **MCP tool/resource cache** leak on server reconnect
- **WebSocket transport** listener leak on reconnect
- **Git root detection cache** unbounded growth in long sessions
- **JSON parsing cache** unbounded growth over time
- **Teammates** retaining all messages after conversation compaction
- **MCP server fetch caches** not cleared on disconnect
- **Subagent progress payloads** retained during context compaction

For anyone running extended Claude Code sessions — and especially those using MCP servers with frequent reconnections or heavy subagent workflows — this release should deliver noticeable improvements in memory consumption.

## Other Improvements

- **MCP OAuth fallback**: Manual URL paste when localhost redirect fails
- **`ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false`**: New env var to opt out of claude.ai MCP servers
- **`/model` command**: Now shows the currently active model in the menu
- **`/copy` command**: Added "Always copy full response" option
- **`/clear` fix**: Cached skills are now properly reset
- **VS Code**: Remote sessions appear in conversation history; session rename/remove added
- **REPL bridge**: Fixed race condition causing message ordering issues during initial connection

## How to Update

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After v2.1.59's auto-memory feature and several stability patches, v2.1.63 represents a significant quality-of-life release. The memory leak fixes alone make it a must-upgrade for power users running long sessions.
