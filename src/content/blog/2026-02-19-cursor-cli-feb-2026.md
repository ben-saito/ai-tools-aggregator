Cursor has shipped a new update to its command-line interface, adding the ability to hand off plans directly to cloud agents, inline rendering of Mermaid diagrams as ASCII, and a collection of quality-of-life fixes focused on tooling and reliability.

## Plan Mode Gets Cloud Handoff

When a plan is generated in the CLI, a persistent decision menu now appears. Developers can choose to execute the plan locally or push it to a cloud agent for background execution.

Typing `/plan` returns to the current plan and its action menu at any time. Keyboard shortcuts have been added to the prompt bar: arrow keys navigate options, Enter executes the selected option, and Shift+Enter serves as a shortcut for "Build in cloud."

## Mermaid Diagrams Render Inline in the Terminal

Mermaid code blocks now render directly as ASCII diagrams within CLI conversations. Supported diagram types include flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines, class diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

Pressing Ctrl+O toggles between the rendered ASCII diagram and the original Mermaid source, allowing developers to inspect both representations without leaving the terminal.

## Additional Improvements

The update also includes a broad set of improvements targeting tooling integration, developer experience, and overall reliability of the CLI. Specific details have not been enumerated in the release notes beyond these categories.
