Anthropic has released Claude Code v2.1.58, expanding the availability of the Remote Control feature to a broader set of users.

## Remote Control Goes Wider

The headline change in v2.1.58 is straightforward: Remote Control, the feature that lets external clients drive a local Claude Code session, is now available to more users.

Remote Control debuted in v2.1.52 via the `claude remote-control` subcommand, enabling IDE extensions and web interfaces to connect to and interact with a locally running Claude Code instance. At launch, access was gated to a limited group. This release widens that gate.

For teams building custom tooling on top of Claude Code — think internal dashboards, CI integrations, or bespoke IDE plugins — this is the kind of quiet infrastructure change that matters more than it looks.

## No v2.1.57

If you're wondering about v2.1.57: it doesn't exist. The version number jumped straight from 2.1.56 to 2.1.58, likely due to an internal build that never shipped publicly.

## The Stabilization Arc Continues

Since v2.1.52's feature-packed release on February 24th, Anthropic has shipped six follow-up versions in roughly 48 hours — all focused on stability and incremental rollouts. The BashTool Windows fix, VS Code crash patches, and now the Remote Control expansion paint a picture of a team methodically hardening a major release rather than rushing to the next feature.

## How to Update

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

The VS Code extension updates automatically from the marketplace.
