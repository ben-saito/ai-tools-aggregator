# Thousands of CEOs Admit AI Had No Impact on Employment or Productivity

## Solow's Paradox Returns After 40 Years

In 1987, Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow issued a stark warning about the Information Age: "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." Despite the advent of transistors, microprocessors, and integrated circuits, productivity growth had slowed from 2.9% (1948-1973) to just 1.1% after 1973.

In February 2026, history is repeating itself.

## 6,000 Executives Testify to the Reality

A study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research surveyed 6,000 CEOs, CFOs, and other executives from the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Australia. The findings are sobering: **nearly 90% of firms reported AI has had no impact on employment or productivity over the last three years.**

Key findings:
- **AI usage time**: Only about 1.5 hours per week
- **Non-users**: 25% of respondents don't use AI at all
- **Users**: About two-thirds reported using AI, but in limited capacity

Intriguingly, **expectations diverge sharply from reality**. The same executives forecast AI will increase productivity by 1.4% over the next three years. Yet their track record over the past three years? Zero.

## The Spotify CEO Contradiction

This survey directly contradicts Spotify CEO Gustav Söderström's February 14th earnings call statement:

**Spotify CEO (Feb 14):**
"When I speak to my most senior engineers — the best developers we have — they actually say that they haven't written a single line of code since December… They actually only generate code and supervise it."

**6,000 CEOs (Feb 17):**
"AI has had no impact on employment or productivity over the last three years."

Which is true? Likely both. Companies like Spotify represent AI-forward outliers, while the majority of businesses remain far behind in AI maturity.

## Warning Signs for the AI Investment Bubble

Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok invoked Solow's observation: "AI is everywhere except in the incoming macroeconomic data. Today, you don't see AI in the employment data, productivity data, or inflation data."

More concerning: **Outside the Magnificent Seven tech giants, there are no signs of AI impacting profit margins or earnings expectations.**

Corporate AI investments swelled to over **$250 billion** in 2024. Yet evidence of productivity gains remains elusive.

## The Trust Collapse

ManpowerGroup's 2026 Global Talent Barometer surveyed nearly 14,000 workers across 19 countries:

- **AI usage**: Up 13% in 2025
- **AI confidence**: Down 18% over the same period

More people are using AI, but fewer believe in it. This suggests AI tools are failing to deliver promised productivity gains.

## The J-Curve Hypothesis: Is There Hope?

Not all is bleak. The IT revolution of the 1970s-80s initially reduced productivity but delivered a 1.5% productivity surge from 1995-2005.

Stanford University's Erik Brynjolfsson argued in the Financial Times that "the trend may already be reversing." His analysis shows:

- **2025 U.S. productivity**: 2.7% growth
- **Q4 GDP growth**: Tracking at 3.7% (with job gains of just 181,000)

This suggests a "transition from AI investment to reaping the benefits." Slok calls this the "J-Curve" pattern: initial performance slowdown followed by exponential surge.

## Implications for Coding Agents

Coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot have proliferated rapidly in 2025-26. However, this survey reveals a crucial distinction: **tool adoption ≠ productivity gains.**

Key differences from the 1980s IT revolution:

**1980s IT Revolution:**
- Innovators had monopoly pricing power
- Competitive products took time to emerge

**2026 AI Revolution:**
- "Fierce competition" among LLM builders drives prices down
- Tools are readily accessible

As Slok notes, "From a macro perspective, the value creation is not the product, but how generative AI is used and implemented in different sectors in the economy."

## Conclusion: Implementation Over Tools

AI coding agents are powerful. Claude Sonnet 4.6 launched February 17th, delivering Opus-level intelligence at Sonnet prices. But **tool performance and company-wide productivity gains are separate issues.**

The testimony of 6,000 CEOs is clear: for the vast majority of companies, AI has not delivered the promised productivity revolution — yet.

However, the IT revolution's history suggests the productivity "J-Curve" may still materialize. The question is whether companies can move beyond simply "using" AI tools to **deeply integrating them into organizational workflows.**

Spotify's CEO vision of "best developers not writing code" remains confined to a handful of AI-forward companies. Whether the remaining 90% of firms reach that future depends on the next few years of implementation.
