Cursor announced on February 12th the research preview of long-running agents, a feature enabling autonomous completion of larger and more complex tasks. This advancement allows the AI to handle work that was previously too difficult for regular agents.

## Key Features

Long-running agents first create a plan before execution, then complete challenging work without requiring human intervention. During research preview and internal testing, these agents successfully tackled tasks that were beyond the capabilities of standard agents, resulting in larger and more comprehensive pull requests with fewer obvious follow-up tasks.

## Availability

The feature is accessible at cursor.com/agents for users on Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise plans.

## Industry Context

The AI coding assistant market is shifting from simple code completion toward more autonomous, sophisticated assistance. Cursor's long-running agents represent a step toward enabling developers to delegate complex tasks like large-scale refactoring and feature implementation to AI.

## Additional Information
