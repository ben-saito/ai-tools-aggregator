GitHub announced Agent HQ in February 2026, a new AI integration platform that provides a unified interface for accessing multiple AI models—Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI Codex, and Gemini (Google)—directly within GitHub repositories and Visual Studio Code.

## Overview

### What is Agent HQ?

Agent HQ enables developers to switch between multiple AI models through a single interface. Previously, each AI service (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) required separate web interfaces or IDE plugins, but Agent HQ provides unified access on GitHub.
