# Spotify's Top Engineers Stop Writing Code, Focus on AI-Generated Code Supervision

Spotify CTO Gustav Söderström revealed during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call on February 11 that the company's most senior engineers have not written a single line of code since December 2025, instead focusing exclusively on supervising AI-generated code.

## The Emergence of "Non-Coding Developers"

Speaking to investors, Söderström stated:

"When I speak to my most senior engineers—the best developers we have—they actually say that they haven't written a single line of code since December. They actually only generate code and supervise it."

Söderström characterized this shift as a matter of "when, not if," emphasizing that Spotify is "absolutely hell-bent on leading that change." He noted that "there is going to have to be a lot of change in these tech companies if you want to stay competitive" because "engineering practices, product practices, and design practices will change."

## Productivity Gains vs. AI Fatigue

Söderström projected that AI adoption will enable dramatic productivity increases, stating that "companies such as us are simply going to produce massively more software, up until our limiting factor is actually the amount of change that consumers are comfortable with."

However, according to Business Insider, software engineers on the ground are reporting "AI fatigue." In a viral essay published this week, software engineer Siddhant Khare wrote that AI is making his job harder, not easier: "Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those PRs" (referring to pull requests).

For engineers, the transition from writing code to reviewing and fixing massive volumes of AI-generated code is not necessarily reducing workload—and in some cases may be increasing it.

## Industry Impact and Future Challenges

Söderström acknowledged the complexity of this transition: "The tricky thing is that we're in the middle of the change, so you also have to be very agile. The things you build now may be useless in a month."

The debate over AI's impact on the global workforce remains divided between those who believe AI will supplant human workers, leading to widespread unemployment, and those who see it as merely enabling more work in less time.

However, Spotify's case provides concrete evidence that, at least in some companies, the role of senior engineers is actively shifting from "writing code" to "supervising and evaluating AI-generated code."

This real-world implementation of what has been termed "vibe coding" marks a significant milestone in the evolution of software development practices, though questions remain about the long-term sustainability and human impact of this approach.
