### Title
```
Show HN: I built an AI tools directory in 1 week
```

### Post
```
Hi HN!

I spent the last week building AI Tools Aggregator - a curated directory of 50+ AI tools across 10 categories.

The problem: Finding good AI tools is scattered across dozens of sites. There's no single source of truth, and it's hard to compare options.

The solution: A fast, searchable directory with:
- 10 categories (text, image, video, audio, code, marketing, productivity, research, design, data)
- Real-time search
- Clean, minimal design
- Free forever
- Open source

Tech stack: Astro + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript. Built as a static site (63 pages) for maximum performance. Bundle size is only 564KB.

Live site: https://ai-tools-aggregator-seven.vercel.app
GitHub: https://github.com/ben-saito/ai-tools-aggregator

This is my first #BuildInPublic project. I'd love your feedback!

Some questions I'd appreciate input on:
- What features would make this more useful?
- What other AI tools should I add?
- Any UX improvements?

Thanks for checking it out!
