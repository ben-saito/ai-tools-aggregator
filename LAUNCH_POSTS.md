## 🧡 Hacker News (Show HN)

### Title
```
Show HN: AI Tools Aggregator – Community-driven directory with reviews & rankings
```

### Post
```
Hey HN! I built a community-driven AI tools directory over the past 2 days.

Live site: https://ai-tools-aggregator-seven.vercel.app

**What it does:**
- 50+ curated AI tools across 10 categories
- User reviews & 5-star ratings
- Real-time trending algorithm (inspired by HN's ranking)
- Community-driven rankings

**Why I built it:**
Most AI tool directories are just static lists or affiliate farms. I wanted something community-driven where real users share their experiences.

**Tech stack:**
- Astro (hybrid SSR/SSG) - incredibly fast
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth) - handles reviews & auth
- Vercel - deployment

**The trending algorithm:**
Inspired by HN's ranking system. Tools with recent reviews and helpful votes rise to the top, but decay over time to keep fresh content surfacing.

Formula: `score = (reviews + helpful_votes * 2) / (age_hours + 2)^1.5`

**Challenges:**
1. Balancing SSG performance with SSR dynamic content (Astro's hybrid mode solved this)
2. Preventing spam reviews (Row Level Security + one review per user per tool)
3. Making rankings feel fair (still iterating on the algorithm)

**What's next:**
- Open sourcing the code
- Adding tool submission workflow
- Building out categories
- Community moderation tools

**Looking for feedback on:**
- The trending algorithm - does it feel fair?
- UI/UX - is it intuitive?
- What features would you want to see?

Happy to answer any questions!

P.S. Built most of this in a single 47-minute sprint using Claude Code. Modern AI tools are wild.

### r/startups

**Title:**
```
Launched AI Tools Aggregator – Community-driven directory (2-day build)
```

**Post:**
```
Just launched: https://ai-tools-aggregator-seven.vercel.app

**What it is:**
Community-driven directory where users review and rank AI tools.

**MVP features:**
- User authentication (GitHub/Google)
- Review system with 5-star ratings
- Trending algorithm
- Community rankings
- 50+ tools across 10 categories

**The pivot:**
Originally planned B2B SaaS (charge tool creators for listings), but realized:
> "Enterprises won't pay an unknown platform"

So pivoted to community-first. Build audience → add value → monetize later.

**Build time:**
- Day 1: Static site (50 tools, 10 categories)
- Day 2: Community features (reviews, rankings, auth) - 47 minutes

**Tech stack:**
- Astro (hybrid SSR/SSG)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- Vercel

**Monetization plan (later):**
- Month 1-3: Build community (free)
- Month 4+: Pro members ($9/month) - ad-free, badges
- Month 6+: Analytics for tool creators ($99/month)

**Metrics goals (Month 1):**
- 500 users
- 1,000 reviews
- 10,000 visitors

**Looking for:**
- Early users & feedback
- Growth advice
- Tools to add

**Questions I have:**
- Is the pivot from B2B to community the right move?
- How to drive initial traffic without budget?
- Best practices for community moderation?

Would love your thoughts!
