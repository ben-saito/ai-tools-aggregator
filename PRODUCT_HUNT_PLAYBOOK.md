Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], founder of AI Tools Hub.

**Why I built this:**
The AI tools landscape is exploding. Every day, new tools launch, but 
finding the RIGHT tool for your specific need is challenging. Existing 
directories are either incomplete, outdated, or lack community feedback.

AI Tools Hub solves this by:
1. Curating only the best tools (quality > quantity)
2. Letting the community add reviews, ratings, and tags
3. Providing advanced search and filtering
4. Allowing users to save favorites and create collections

**What makes us different:**
• User-generated tags for better discovery
• Favorites system (like your personal tool library)
• Vendor portal for tool creators
• Lead generation for qualified prospects
• Free API for developers

**What's next:**
• AI-powered recommendations
• Tool comparison feature
• Mobile app
• Community forum

**I'd love your feedback on:**
• What features would you like to see?
• Which AI tools should we add next?
• How can we improve the discovery experience?

Thanks for checking us out! Feel free to ask me anything. 🚀

P.S. We're offering early adopter benefits - claim your favorite tools 
now and get featured when we launch premium features!
